# Vulkan Renderer Engine

A high-performance web browser engine built with Rust and Vulkan, featuring JavaScript JIT compilation, PWA support, and advanced sandboxing.

## Features

- **Vulkan-based Rendering**: Hardware-accelerated graphics using Vulkan API
- **JavaScript JIT Engine**: High-performance V8-based JavaScript execution with custom JIT optimization
- **PWA Support**: Complete Progressive Web App runtime with service workers and caching
- **Multi-process Sandboxing**: Secure process isolation with fine-grained permissions
- **Cross-platform**: Support for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Modern Web APIs**: Serial Port, WebGL, WebAssembly, and more

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/vulkan-renderer
cd vulkan-renderer
./install.sh
cargo run --release
```

## Architecture

The engine is structured into several core modules:

- `core/`: DOM, CSS parsing, layout engine
- `js_engine/`: JavaScript runtime with JIT compilation
- `renderer/`: Vulkan-based graphics pipeline
- `pwa/`: Progressive Web App runtime
- `sandbox/`: Security and process isolation
- `platform/`: OS-specific implementations
